.. teaser-begin

**inbus** stands for **in**\ connu message **bus** and is targeted at small
devices running a limited number of applications exchanging small
messages. It has a single goal: simple, connectionless brokering 
of messages between one or more publishers and one or more 
subscribers.

* Central broker:  no complex relationships
* Limited scope: Does not try to be all things to all people
* Connectionless: No flow control, no guaranteed message delivery 
* Simple JSON based protocol
