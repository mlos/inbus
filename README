The INcredible message BUS

- Target usage:
	Small devices with a limited number of applications exchanging small
	messages.

- Does not try to do more than one thing: broadcasting publisher to subscribers
- Central broker
- Connectionless  (UDP)
- No flow control or session management 
- Consequences: clients that do not unsubscribe gracefully will remain in the pool

- Message Protocol
