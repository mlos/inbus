NOTE:
Use of the words, must, should, could, etc. adheres to the best practice
suggested in RFC2119 (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)

DESCRIPTION:
Protocol messages MUST be specified in the following JSON format:

{   
    "version" : <inbus-version>,
    "opcode" : <opcode>, 
    "application" :[ <app-key>, <app-type> ], 
    "address" : [ <ip-number>, <port> ], 
    "payload" : <payload>
}

All messages MUST contain all elements, even if they are not used.

Elements that do not apply to a particular type of message (as
defined by its <opcode>), SHOULD be an empty string or zero,
depending on the data type.

<inbus-version> Integer specifying the Inbus version.
<opcode> Integer specifying the type of message
    0: reserved
    1: subscribe
    2: unsubscribe
    3: publish
    4-999: reserved
<app-key> String identifying the application to which
    the message applies. 
    The value "*" is reserved for future use.
<app-type> Integer, specifying an application defined 
    value. Can be used to distinguish multiple messages
    related to the same application.
    The element only applies to publish messages.
    The value 0 is reserved for future use.
<ip-number> String containing an IP number part of the
    subscriber address. In case of a publish message,
    the element does not apply.
<port> Integer containing the port number of the subscriber
    address. In case of a publish message, the element 
    does NOT apply.
    The subscriber address, together with the app-key 
    uniquely identifies a subscription.
<payload> String specifying a user defined payload.
    This implies that binary data must be string-encoded.
    The element only applies to publish messages.

INFRASTRUCTURE
The protocol SHOULD use port 7222

EXAMPLE MESSAGES

SUBSCRIBE
{   "version" : 1 , "opcode" : 1, "application" : [ "upnp", 0 ], "address" : [ "127.0.0.1", 3456 ], "payload" : "" }

Subscription message indicating that the subscriber wants to receive messages from an application that publishes
messages under the "upnp" app-key.


UNSUBSCRIBE
{   "version" : 1 , "opcode" : 2, "application" : [ "upnp", 0 ], "address" : [ "127.0.0.1", 3456 ], "payload" : "" }

Message indicating that the subscriber no longer wants to receive messages from the application that publishes
messages under the "upnp" app-key.

PUBLISH

{   "version" : 1 , "opcode" : 3, "application" : [ "upnp", 17 ], "address" : [ "", 0 ], "payload" : "Omega - Gammapolis I. - 0:45" }

Message sent by the application using the app-key "upnp", using app-type 17.
